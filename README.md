# TypeScript Concepts 2023!

## What is TypeScript?
TypeScript is a language that is built on top of JavaScript with the purpose of helping us avoid the common pitfalls and bugs that arise in JavaScript. And the way that it does that is by adding types.

## Characteristics

- **Static Checking:** TypeScript detect errors in our code **without running it.** This is called static checking.

- **Type Checking:** TypeScript does this error checking on the basis of the "kinds of data" in our program AKA types!


## TypeScript keys
- **What is the main difference between types and interface:** Interfaces can only describe the shape of an object.

## Benefits
- Helps us find errors!
- Analyzes our code as we type
- Only exists in dev env

## Requirements
- **NPM:** v6.9.0
- **NODE:** v10.16.3
